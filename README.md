## Instruction
It is a dormitory reservation system.
There are daily, monthly and fitness room bookings. Customers can press to reserve by choosing the type of accommodation they want. Customers will see images of the room to be reserved and details of each room type along with the price to be paid. Customers can choose to pay immediately after booking or on the day of their stay by paying directly at the dormitory. If it is a monthly room, there will not be an online contract. The customer must enter into the contract in person. You can make an appointment to sign a contract with the dormitory. The main thing is to reserve a room. Specify check in and check out.
